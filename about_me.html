                    While it may seem like a daunting task to reduce one's life to a paragraph or two, hopefully this blurb can give you somewhat of an idea of what I'm like as a coworker.
                    I was born and raised in San Diego, CA and while I've never surfed a day in my life, I feel as though the laid-back spirit of my hometown often helps me to "breathe in, breathe out, and move on".
                    However, I'm never one to give up. I constantly take on strenuous challenges, sometimes just for the sake of the challenge, whether it be running marathons, perfecting a homemade sourdough loaf (after 13 tries), or continuously enrolling in computer science related programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an incredible passionate person, and employee, where I work and what I do matters deeply to me. I have a desire to work for a company with a progressive vision. 
                    While I am fascinated by the tools we have now to analyze, and assign meaning to giant databases, I am even more excited by the future of data science. 
                    In my free time I am constantly taking in information on automated intelligence be it audiobook, articles, or blog posts.
                    The intersection between real life problem-solving and our machine counterparts' ability to see the world in ways unfathomable just years ago, is what inspires me every day.
                    I have experience as a marketing manager, analyzing large data sets, and in web development. I consider myself a well-rounded technical individual, but am constantly looking to improve my skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if you're looking for conversation starters between technical interviews, I'm a massive soccer fan (COYS), running enthusiast, amateur baker, self-pronounced IPA snob, and an ever willing hiking partner. Or of course we could just chat about AI, a subject that I'm always happy to talk about.
                </p>
